# CollectionFramework
<br>
//Difference Between Array and Collection Framework
<br>
//1.Arrays can store  both the data type like primitive and non-primitive
<br>
// - object we can also store.
<br>
//Array only store homogeneous type of data (mean same type of data).
<br>
//Array sized is fixed (we can not change the size at run time).
<br>
//Array are inbuilt feature in java and we have to develop the algorithm.
<br>
//Collection Framework we can only store non-primitive type of data.(its mean it only stores the object).
<br>
//ArrayList a=new ArrayList<>() a.add(10)-->we can insert 10.it is a object (using wrapper class).
<br>
//We can store the heterogeneous  type of data.(mean we can store different type data).
<br>
//We can increase and decrease the size of collection framework.
<br>
//Collection framework api which provide predefine classes ,interface and method.

//* DataStructure -: It is the way by which we can store   the data in  efficient way. (efficient->time , space).
<br>
//* Type of DS - > There are two type : 1.Primitive  2.Non-Primitive
<br>
//Primitive -> 1.boolean 2.char 3.int 4.byte 5.short 6.int 7.long 8.float 9.double
<br>
//Non-Primitive-> 1.Linear  2.Non-Linear
<br>
//  Linear ->String , arrays , list , set  , queue , Arraylist , hashset , Linked Hash set etc.
<br>
//Non-Linear -> Graph , tree
<br>
<br>

<br>
//API -> API (Application Programming Interface) in Java is a set of predefined rules and specifications for
<br>
// accessing a web-based software application or web tool.It offers a way for developers to interact or
<br>
// integrate two different systems, allowing for easy exchange of data and communication.
<br>
<br>
//*  API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and specifications that allow two
// applications to communicate.
