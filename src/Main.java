//Difference Between Array and Collection Framework
//1.Arrays can store  both the data type like primitive and non-primitive
// - object we can also store.
//Array only store homogeneous type of data (mean same type of data).
//Array sized is fixed (we can not change the size at run time).
//Array are inbuilt feature in java and we have to develop the algorithm.

//Collection Framework we can only store non-primitive type of data.(its mean it only stores the object).
//ArrayList a=new ArrayList<>() a.add(10)-->we can insert 10.it is a object (using wrapper class).
//We can store the heterogeneous  type of data.(mean we can store different type data).
//We can increase and decrease the size of collection framework.
//Collection framework api which provide predefine classes ,interface and method.

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

    }
}



//* DataStructure -: It is the way by which we can store   the data in  efficient way. (efficient->time , space).
//* Type of DS - > There are two type : 1.Primitive  2.Non-Primitive
//Primitive -> 1.boolean 2.char 3.int 4.byte 5.short 6.int 7.long 8.float 9.double
//Non-Primitive-> 1.Linear  2.Non-Linear
//  Linear ->String , arrays , list , set  , queue , Arraylist , hashset , Linked Hash set etc.
//Non-Linear -> Graph , tree


//API -> API (Application Programming Interface) in Java is a set of predefined rules and specifications for
// accessing a web-based software application or web tool.It offers a way for developers to interact or
// integrate two different systems, allowing for easy exchange of data and communication.
